# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

At the start of the subject my estimates were not very accurate. Most of the time they were too low.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the weeks went on, I started to get a better sense for how long different kinds of tasks would take.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that breaking the prac into smaller tasks makes estimating much easier.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Most of the reviews I received stated that my codes were good.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing other people’s code helped me practise reading code carefully and checking it against the style guide.
I got to see how other students write certain things like their docstrings.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

I did well at keeping my GitHub repositories organised and committing regularly with meaningful messages.
