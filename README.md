# CP1404 Practicals

## About this repository
My name is Sylvia an international student from Kenya, I am studying IT at JCU.
Weekly practical work for CP1404. 
I keep things tidy with small commits, branches like `prac_07_feedback`, and reviews via pull requests.


## What we learn 
- Using clear, meaningful names.
- Having functions which have one job.
- Using constants instead of magic numbers.
- DRY — do not repeat yourself; refactor common code into functions.
